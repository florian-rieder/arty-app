Arty was initially made during the spring semester 2021, as a student project in the class "Projet de DÃ©veloppement Logiciel" (Software Development Project) under the direction of prof. Davide Picca.

Development then continued on furthering the application's features and user experience, in order to make Arty available to students and all interested people, with the guidance of Mr. Picca.
