                    Arty is an organisational tool designed to help users manage 
                    and work with a corpus of artworks in an academic setting. 
                    By streamlining common tasks such as image tagging, viewing, 
                    and comparison, Arty aims to simplify the research process and 
                    boost productivity. With Arty, users can easily annotate and 
                    organise their images, compare multiple artworks side by side, 
                    and export their corpus to Powerpoint or CSV formats. While 
                    Arty is somewhat limited by the technologies it relies on, 
                    it can make academic research more  efficient and effective 
                    for those who work with image-based data.

        it easier to organize, annotate, view, and compare images of artworks.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Arty, you have everything you need to stay organized, analyze digitized 
        artworks, and create compelling presentations with ease. Try it out today and 
        discover how it can help streamline your art history research and study.
    </p>

    <h3>Organize</h3>

    <p>
        One of Arty's main features is its ability to help you organize your images 
        effortlessly. Simply keep all your images in a folder on your computer, and 
        each folder becomes a corpus that you can open with Arty. From there, you 
        can easily annotate your images with relevant information such as artist, 
        title, and datation, helping you keep everything in order and easily 
        searchable.
    </p>

    <h3>Compare</h3>

    <p>
        Arty also makes it simple to compare up to 4 images at once, helping you 
        spot the similarities and differences between different artworks. This 
        feature is perfect for side-by-side analysis and can be incredibly useful 
        for research and analysis purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>Export</h3>

    <p>
        Arty also lets you export your entire corpus or a selection of images to 
        a Powerpoint presentation with automatic captions. This is a fantastic 
        option for quickly creating presentations that include annotated images 
        of artworks.
    </p>
    <p>
        And for even more advanced uses, Arty allows you to export your corpus to CSV, 
        while the application's collection file (.arty extension) is itself a JSON document.
